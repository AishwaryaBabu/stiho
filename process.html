      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
      	Craftsmanship and knowledge about product and application modes are disappearing rapidly in the Dutch construction industry, ageing being the main reason. The loss of knowledge and skills is already causing problems in maintaining the quality of projects in this industry.<br /> <br />

To address this concern the MediaLAB Amsterdam and the project assigner, STIHO, formulated the question "How can these skills and knowledge be preserved and circulated to future generations through digital storytelling?".<br /> <br />

STIHO, a leading construction materials and tools dealer in the Netherlands, wishes to take the lead in facilitating this circulation of knowledge. The audience that STIHO wants to target comprises construction companies active in building, renovation and the development of small new building projects.

      <h1> Research phase </h1>
		This was an important phase since the research outcomes would form the basis of our ideas and concepts. We did desk research in order to understand the existing methods of knowledge transfer in the construction industry and to learn about the multimedia technologies being currently used. We also conducted interviews with the various stakeholders i.e. STIHO employees, customers and suppliers. Observations on the STIHO bouwplein and field visits with the STIHO sales representatives helped us understand the relationship among the stakeholders.<br />
 We gained many important insights from our research which helped us direct our thinking in the right direction.  
 
      <h1> Concept Phase </h1>
      Using the insights of our research we tried to develop concepts that would be a solution to our problem statement while catering to the needs of all the stakeholders. Some of the important research findings were that the STIHO employee-customer relationship is personal, members of this industry learn better by discussion and experience rather than by reading and that construction workers use smartphones and various apps. With these in mind we came up with 3 concepts of which our assigner, Bruno Giebels, chose one. <br /> <br />
The chosen concept was that of a multimedia chat application which focuses on speech. We worked on developing this idea further in order to have a complete concept with well defined features which cater to the insights of our research. 
      
      <h1> Design Phase </h1>
      When we had finalized the various aspects of our app, we began working on the design of the app. We started with paper prototyping which is a cheap and fast method to imitate the user interface. Once we had a logical structure for the app we transferred the layout to a virual wireframe followed by designing the look annd feel of the app. <br />
We focused on keeping the design familiar and simple so that the end users do not require a lot of time to get acquainted with the app.  
      
      <h1> Development Phase </h1>
      Once our designs were in progress we hired a developer, Brian Sahertian (Clicksmash), to build a working prototype of the app for iOS. Feedback from our developer were incorporated in our designs and vice versa. This iterative process helped in improving our designs and visual structure rendering it more user-friendly.
